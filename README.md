Building a CI Pipeline with Jenkins is the first assignment for the "Learn CI/CD Implementation" course. I built a CI/CD pipeline for a React app with Jenkins Pipeline, NGINX, and Poll SCM in this project. Added deployment stages with input mechanism, termination, and manual approval. Integrated Jenkins Pipeline with Prometheus and Grafana with customized Docker container ports. Made app deployable to cloud providers with AWS option.
