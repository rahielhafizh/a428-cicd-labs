This is the first project of the course “Learn CI/CD Implementation”. The project focuses on creating a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an application using Jenkins Pipeline and NGINX. It automates the build, test, and deployment process, and includes steps for input mechanisms, manual approvals, and error handling. Monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Docker containers are configured for port management. The deployment is optimized for a cloud provider, such as AWS. This project applies skills in DevOps, continuous integration, and monitoring, and creates a reliable automated workflow.
