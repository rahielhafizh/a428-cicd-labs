# **Learn CI/CD Implementation**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on creating a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an application using Jenkins Pipeline and NGINX. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process and includes steps for input mechanisms, manual approvals, and error handling. Additionally, monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Docker containers is configured for port management. The deployment is optimized for cloud providers such as AWS, applying skills in DevOps, continuous integration, and monitoring to establish a reliable automated workflow.

## **Key Features**
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Jenkins Pipeline**: Configures Jenkins Pipeline for seamless CI/CD operations.
- **NGINX**: Implements NGINX as the web server for the application.
- **Monitoring**: Integrates Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive application monitoring.
- **Docker**: Utilizes Docker containers for application isolation and management.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Optimized for cloud platforms like AWS.
